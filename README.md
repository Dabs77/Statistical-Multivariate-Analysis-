# Statistical-Multivariate-Analysis-

## Introduction 

In the immense complexity of the life we have to analyse many variables to take an decition, however, there are factors that are more important than others in terms of an objective, for example: when you are chopsing an potential couple you take in care multiple variables that have an specific value for this person, in other words, you can preefer an person kind, smart, funny but at the same time maybe you like the green eyes girls or the muscle mens, all of this characteristics explain th investigation unit (or in more simple words, the person of this row), now why is important say this?, well when you study an event and all the characteristics that are around it you will need to establish the relations that are between all of them, this is the Multivariate Analysis.

In more formal terms multivariate analysis is a set of statistical techniques used to analyze data that involves multiple variables to understand the relationships between them and to model complex phenomena. This analysis helps in making predictions and inferences about the data by considering multiple factors at once. At this point could be an valid question "What is multivariate data?" well it refers to datasets that contain measurements or observations on more than one variable for each individual or entity.

Retaking the last example, in an RANDOM case, when a men is looking for an potential girlfriend, when he goes to an bar and star talking with random girls, his head could see like this:

Name | Level of charisma | Age | Color of eyes | Height | She like's Coldplay? | Is she single? | Should I ask for her number? |
Paula|         9         |  19 |     Green     |  1.60  |        Yes           |       yes      |               yes            |
Maria|         4         |  24 |     Brown     |  1.72  |        No            |       yes      |               No             | 
Nina |        ...        | ... |    ......     | ...... |       ....           |       ...      |              ...             |

In this scenario we could say that the variables are all of this characteristics that come from each girl and each girl is what in statistic we called investigation unit (Paula is IU1, Maria IU2) and at the same time we could said that there are some variables that are correlated like "Should I ask for her number?" and "Is she single?" is for this that we could be interested in study how could be correlated other variables like "Should I ask for her number?" and "Color of eyes" or even try to prove independence or dependence on them.

Inside the Multivariate Analysis exists many methods to different goals that we couuld select and implement depending of the nature of the problem undestanding thestrenghts of each method but also their limitations. All of this methods could let us create hypothesis about some characteristics of the SAMPLE no the population, like in our example, he could said that Paula is the best girl to meet AT THIS BAR but it would be so silly to thik that is the best girl in the world for him.

For do this analysis we could use different multivariate methods like:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. Techniques include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis, which simplify data without losing much information.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Common methods include k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
- **Discriminant Analysis**: Used to determine which variables discriminate between two or more naturally occurring groups. This is particularly useful in the classification of individuals into categories.
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis**: Used to explore the relationships between two sets of multivariate data. This method identifies pairs of variables from the sets which have the highest correlations with each other.
- **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**: Aiming to place each object in N-dimensional space such that the between-object distances are preserved as well as possible. This is used for visualizing the similarity between objects.
- **Multiple Regression Analysis**: Used to understand the relationship between a single dependent variable and several independent variables. This helps in predicting the dependent variable based on the independents.
- **Logistic Regression**: Particularly used when the dependent variable is binary. It models the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead.
